###  <p align="center">There are only two things that are indispensable for the survival of modern man: pizza and technology. </br>  And I love them both.</p>

<p>Enough with the pizza stuff 🍕 Let me introduce myself and what you can find here</p>

<h2>What you can expect to find here</h2>

<p>My intention is to build some, I hope, interesting stuff in the near future. At the moment you can find:</p>
<p>
  📊 Some fantasy football support application (focused on the Italian league)</br>
  ⚽ Some sport related mini-games, such as a simple football championship simulator</br>
  📖 Some practice materials that I've built during my learning process </br>
  🔧 Some utilities web apps, that I intend to build to make my life "easier" or to optimize some tasks or activities
</p>

<h2>About myself</h2>



<p>I've always had a passion for technology, but I only recently approached programming in a more structured way 🤓 </br> At the moment, I'm simply in love with coding 💙 </p> 
<h3>What I used to do</h3>

I have <b>quite an “uncommon” background</b>, with six years of experience in the marketing field, including both hands-on work and leadership roles.

Let’s say that I was kind of the <b>“techy guy” of the team</b> ⚙️  

During my time as a Marketing Specialist and subsequently as a Head of Marketing at an Italian IT distributor, I was also responsible for the <b>discovery and adoption of new technologies</b></p>

What I really liked about that job was:
<ul>
  <li><b>Solving </b>logical <b>problems</b></li>
  <li>Finding out <b>how</b> certain pieces of <b>software work</b></li>
  <li><b>Playing around with HTML and CSS</b>, in order to build and customize landing pages</li>
  <li><b>Designing</b> automated <b>workflows</b> in HubSpot</li>
</ul></br>
...but it was only a part of my previous job and the time that I spent on those activities was gradually decreasing 😩 </br>

<h3>The epiphany</h3>

<p>At the begining of 2023, I asked myself... <br> <br>
  What am I doing? 😕 </br>
  Is there any job out there that allows me to solve logical problems while working with technology? 🤔
</p>

<p>

  💡 Of course there is!</p>
<p>You probably already know what I'm talking about, and you can likely imagine what happened next ✨ </p>
