<p>Enough with the pizza stuff 🍕 Let me introduce myself and what you can find here</p>

<h2>About myself</h2>



<p>I've always had a passion for technology, but I only recently approached programming in a more structured way 🤓 </br> At the moment, I'm simply in love with coding 💙 </p> 
<h3>What I used to do</h3>

I have <b>quite an “uncommon” background</b>, with six years of experience in the marketing field, including both hands-on work and leadership roles.

During those years I’ve improved my skills in:</br></br>
👉 technology integration</br>
👉 project management</br>
👉 business development</br>

Let’s say that I was kind of the <b>“techy guy” of the team</b> ⚙️  

During my time as a Marketing Specialist and subsequently as a Head of Marketing at an Italian IT distributor, I was responsible for the discovery and adoption of new technologies</p>

What I really liked about that job was:
<ul>
  <li>Solving logical problems</li>
  <li>Finding out how certain pieces of software work</li>
  <li>Playing around with HTML and CSS in order to build and customize landing pages</li>
  <li>Designing automated workflows in HubSpot</li>
</ul></br>
...but it was only a part of my previous job and the time that I spent on those activities was gradually decreasing 😩

<h3>The epiphany</h3>

<p>At the begining of 2023, I asked myself... <br> <br>
  What am I doing? 😕 </br>
  Is there any job out there that allows me to solve logical problems while working with technology? 🤔
</p>

<p>

  💡 Of course there is!</p>
<p>You already know what I'm talking about and, probably, you can imagine what happened after ✨ </p>

<h2>What you can expect to find here</h2>

<p>My intention is to build some, I hope, interesting stuff in the near future. At the moment you can find:</p>
<p>
  📊 Some fantasy football support application (focused on the Italian league)</br>
  ⚽ Some sport related mini-games, such as a simple football championship simulator</br>
  📖 some practice materials that I've built during my learning process </br>
  🔧 Some utilities web apps, that I intend to build to make my life "easier" or to optimize some tasks or activities
